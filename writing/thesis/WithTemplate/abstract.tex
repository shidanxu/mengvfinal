This project involves learning to predict users' mobility within the network topology. Topological mobility, as opposed to physical mobility, can be substantial as a user switches from LTE to wifi network, while moving minimally physically. Our dataset consists of email IMAP logs as they document associated client IP addresses, as well as the clients' identifiers. Prediction for online mobility is of particular interest to the networks community. If we can predict online mobility with high probability, then new network architecture can be designed to optimize the caching system by minimizing resending packets.  We used various approaches and techniques to model the user's behavior, including probabilistic programming, regression, neural nets, and clustering algorithms. We compare and contrast how models differ in their prediction accuracy, speed of convergence, and algorithmic complexity.
